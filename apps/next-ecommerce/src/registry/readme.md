Dividing the registered components map into "page-wise" sections might not necessarily improve efficiency as the number of components grows. Here's why:

Reasons:

---

Maps are Efficient for Lookups:
Maps offer efficient key lookups regardless of their size. Unlike traditional objects, key lookups in Maps have a time complexity of O(1) on average, meaning retrieval time stays constant even with a large number of components.

Modern Browsers Optimize Maps:
Modern browsers are optimized for working with Maps. They use techniques like hashing to ensure fast access to values based on keys.

Overhead of Dividing and Managing:
Dividing the map into separate page-wise structures adds complexity. You'll need additional logic to handle situations where a component might be used across multiple pages. This overhead could potentially negate any perceived performance gains.
