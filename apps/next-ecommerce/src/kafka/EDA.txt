## Kafka Consumer for Order Processing (Event-Driven Approach)

This document describes a NodeJS serverless function that implements an event-driven approach for processing order confirmation emails using Apache Kafka.

**Functionality:**

- Consumes messages from a Kafka topic (`order-topic`).
- Decodes messages using a schema registry.
- Triggers processing logic based on the message content (currently, sending order confirmation emails).
- Provides a configuration mechanism to map topics to processing functions.

**Benefits:**

- **Asynchronous Processing:** Improves responsiveness by sending emails asynchronously, allowing the consumer to continue processing other messages.
- **Decoupled Logic:** Processing logic is separated from message consumption, promoting maintainability and reusability.
- **Scalability:** The consumer can be scaled horizontally to handle increased message volumes.

**Usage:**

1. **Configuration:**
    - Define processing functions for different topics in the `consumerConfiguration` object.
    - Each configuration object should include `groupId`, `topic`, and a `processor` function that handles the decoded data.
2. **Execution:**
    - Call the `kafkaConsumer` function, passing the appropriate configuration object.

**Requirements:**

- Kafka server and schema registry running.
- `kafkajs` library installed (`yarn add kafkajs`).

**Code Structure:**

- `consumerConfiguration.ts`: Defines the configuration object for topic-specific processing functions.
- `kafkaConsumer.ts`: Implements the consumer logic, subscribing to the topic, decoding messages, and triggering processing based on configuration.
- `kafkaProducer.ts` (Optional): Provides a function to publish data to a Kafka topic (not intended for Next.js middlewares due to Node.js runtime limitations).

**Documentation:**

- Each function includes JSDoc comments for better code understanding.

**Deployment:**

- This code can be deployed as a serverless function in a Node.js environment.

**Next Steps:**

- Consider implementing additional processing functions for different message types.
- Explore error handling strategies for message processing failures.
- Integrate with any email service provider for email delivery.
